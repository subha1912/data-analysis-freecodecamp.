#mean-var-std

Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.

If a list containing less than 9 elements is passed into the function, it should raise a ValueError exception with the message: "List must contain nine numbers." The values in the returned dictionary should be lists and not Numpy arrays.

#demograhic data analyzer

How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
What is the average age of men?
What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.
Use the starter code in the file demographic_data_analyzer.py

#medical data visualizer

By each number in the medical_data_visualizer.py file, add the code from the associated instruction number below.

Import the data from medical_examination.csv and assign it to the df variable
Create the overweight column in the df variable
Normalize data by making 0 always good and 1 always bad. If the value of cholesterol or gluc is 1, set the value to 0. If the value is more than 1, set the value to 1.
Draw the Categorical Plot in the draw_cat_plot function
Create a DataFrame for the cat plot using pd.melt with values from cholesterol, gluc, smoke, alco, active, and overweight in the df_cat variable.
Group and reformat the data in df_cat to split it by cardio. Show the counts of each feature. You will have to rename one of the columns for the catplot to work correctly.
Convert the data into long format and create a chart that shows the value counts of the categorical features using the following method provided by the seaborn library import : sns.catplot()
Get the figure for the output and store it in the fig variable
Do not modify the next two lines
Draw the Heat Map in the draw_heat_map function
Clean the data in the df_heat variable by filtering out the following patient segments that represent incorrect data:
height is less than the 2.5th percentile (Keep the correct data with (df['height'] >= df['height'].quantile(0.025)))
height is more than the 97.5th percentile
weight is less than the 2.5th percentile
weight is more than the 97.5th percentile
Calculate the correlation matrix and store it in the corr variable
Generate a mask for the upper triangle and store it in the mask variable
Set up the matplotlib figure
Plot the correlation matrix using the method provided by the seaborn library import: sns.heatmap()

#page view time series visualizer

Use Pandas to import the data from "fcc-forum-pageviews.csv". Set the index to the date column.
Clean the data by filtering out days when the page views were in the top 2.5% of the dataset or bottom 2.5% of the dataset.
Create a draw_line_plot function that uses Matplotlib to draw a line chart similar to "examples/Figure_1.png". The title should be Daily freeCodeCamp Forum Page Views 5/2016-12/2019. The label on the x axis should be Date and the label on the y axis should be Page Views.
Create a draw_bar_plot function that draws a bar chart similar to "examples/Figure_2.png". It should show average daily page views for each month grouped by year. The legend should show month labels and have a title of Months. On the chart, the label on the x axis should be Years and the label on the y axis should be Average Page Views.
Create a draw_box_plot function that uses Seaborn to draw two adjacent box plots similar to "examples/Figure_3.png". These box plots should show how the values are distributed within a given year or month and how it compares over time. The title of the first chart should be Year-wise Box Plot (Trend) and the title of the second chart should be Month-wise Box Plot (Seasonality). Make sure the month labels on bottom start at Jan and the x and y axis are labeled correctly. The boilerplate includes commands to prepare the data.

#sea level predictor

Use Pandas to import the data from epa-sea-level.csv.
Use matplotlib to create a scatter plot using the Year column as the x-axis and the CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level column as the y-axis.
Use the linregress function from scipy.stats to get the slope and y-intercept of the line of best fit. Plot the line of best fit over the top of the scatter plot. Make the line go through the year 2050 to predict the sea level rise in 2050.
Plot a new line of best fit just using the data from year 2000 through the most recent year in the dataset. Make the line also go through the year 2050 to predict the sea level rise in 2050 if the rate of rise continues as it has since the year 2000.
The x label should be Year, the y label should be Sea Level (inches), and the title should be Rise in Sea Level.
